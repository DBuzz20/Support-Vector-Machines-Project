# Machine Learning Project - SVM
Project for the "Optimization Methods for Machine Learning" course.

Master's degree course in "Business Intelligence and Analytics" (Management engineering's curricula).

## Project Description
The project, developed in `Python`, involves the implementation of various approaches and techniques regarding `Support Vector Machines` in machine learning, putting particular emphasis on the optimization side of the developement.

The 4 implementations of the project required developing concepts like: Dual SVM, gradient method, grid search (with kfold cross validation), SVM light and worker's selection, Sequential Minimal Optimization with Most violating pair, multi-class SVM ecc.

## Files
The `Assignment.pdf` file contains all the details about the requests of each question, that are then developed in their own file inside the `Code` folder.
Also, the `Final_report.pdf` file describes the approach followed when developing such questions, explaining the decisions taken and all the performance results of such implementations (both in time and precision).
The report also provides various graphs and comments about the development, including a final comparison between all the developed techiniques.
